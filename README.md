## Inspiration
As a Cloud and DevOps practitioner, I was bothered about building a personal website and a solid way to demonstrate my skills on Cloud and DevOps tools. I came across this challenge by Forrest Brazeal and I decided to give it a shot.
Here is my solution to the [Azure](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/) version.
